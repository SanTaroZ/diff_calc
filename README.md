Calculate the difference between the theorical weight of the product vs the weight shown on a scale.

The purpose of this project is to calculate the difference between the theorical weight of the product vs the weight shown on a scale in order to determine if there is a considerable deviation that could affect the monthly balance in the factory. 
The challenge here is to cross and process the information registered from all the products, machines and scales of the factory, this is the reason we use python to create a program that throw the difference calculated and from this information focus on the machines or scales that have considerable variation between theoretical and real weight.
